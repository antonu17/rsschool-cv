## Code sample

This is a code I wrote to solve [Digits explosion](https://www.codewars.com/kata/585b1fafe08bae9988000314) task on codewars.

```javascript
function explode(s) {
  let result = '';

  for (let c of s) {
    for (let i = 0; i < +c; i++) {
      result += c
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```
